# PasswordGenerator

This password generator will create a password based on a user's criteria. The user will select in a series of prompts the password length and which characters should be used: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. It requires a length of between 8 and 128 characters and must include at least one of the four characters to operate.
